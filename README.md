Hello! My name is phseiff, and I'm an avid hobby developer, manga-binge-reader, vegetarian, programmer, writer and denglish-speaker.

In my free time, I work on holistic software projects with a social vision (like my newest project, [gender\*render](https://github.com/phseiff/gender-render)), draw and design (for example [my website](https://phseiff.com)), post about my thoughts on [mastodon](https://toot.phseiff.com), and socialise with fellow enthusiasts.

I also love good food, especially cheese.

Feel free to drop me an email, raise an issue on github or contact me on mastodon if you feel like it; I'm always up for problem solving and an intellectual exchange.
